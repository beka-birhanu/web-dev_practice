# Web Development Practice Projects

This repository contains some of the web apps that I created as part of my web development journey. I made these apps to practice and improve my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web technologies. Each app has its own folder with the source code.

## Technologies and Tools

- HTML

- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- jQuery
- Font Awesome
- Google Fonts

## Apple Home Page Replica

This app is a replica of the Apple home page using HTML and CSS. I made this app to practice the basics of CSS layout, such as containers, units (px, em, rem, %), positioning, flexbox, grid, etc.

## Puppy Lovers Page

This app is a web page for puppy lovers based on a design provided by the Evangadi Tech instructors on my course of full stack (MERN stack). The purpose of this app is to learn how to make a web page responsive using only the @media tag in CSS.
